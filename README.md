# point cloud annotator

 Tool for labeling of single point clouds or a stream of point clouds, which we used over the years to label
 many, many point clouds. From this experience, we hope to provide all the tools and features you need to 
 label even complicated objects effortlessly.

## Features:
 - Supports many point cloud files right from the start and simple plugin development for other file types
 - Human-readable label description files in xml allow to define label names, ids, and colors
 - Modern OpenGL shaders and view frustrum culling for rendering of even millions of points
 - Tools for labeling of individual points, areas, and filling segments
 - Filtering of labels makes it easy to label even complicated structures with ease
